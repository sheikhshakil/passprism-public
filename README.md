# PassPrism
PassPrism is a web application that provides password management services. Users can create an account here and then they can generate strong passwords as well as securely store their precious passwords in PassPrism's secure database. This erases fear of losing or forgetting their precious passwords.

Database Security Key and .env files are not uploaded here as it's a public repository. As a result project can't be run properly by cloning this repository.
I have another private repository for this project to run it properly.
